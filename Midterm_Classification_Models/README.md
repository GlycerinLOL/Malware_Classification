# Dataset and Model Checkpoint Folder Structure
Due to the large file storage limit, the original dataset files and model checkpoint files will not be uploaded to this repository. You will need to download the datasets by yourself from the specified websites and generate the checkpoint files through model training. The datasets and ckpt (checkpoint) folders are organized to facilitate organized storage and access for dataset images and model training results, respectively. Below is an overview of the folder structure and the content each folder contains.

# Folder Structure
## Dataset
```
datasets/
│
├── malimg_paper_dataset_imgs/
│ ├── Class1/
│ │ ├── image1.jpg
│ │ ├── image2.jpg
│ │ └── ...
│ ├── Class2/
│ │ ├── image1.jpg
│ │ ├── image2.jpg
│ │ └── ...
│ └── ...
│
└── virusShare/
│ ├── Class1/
│ │ ├── image1.jpg
│ │ ├── image2.jpg
│ │ └── ...
│ ├── Class2/
│ │ ├── image1.jpg
│ │ ├── image2.jpg
│ │ └── ...
│ └── ...
```
Ensure that each class's images are properly placed in their respective directories under `malimg_paper_dataset_imgs` and `virusShare`. This structure facilitates the organized storage and access of dataset images for processing and analysis.

## Checkpoint
```
ckpt/
│
├── malimg/
│ ├── model.pth
| └── ...
│
└── virusShare/
│ ├── model.pth
| └── ...
```
The `ckpt` folder contains the model checkpoint files generated during model training. The checkpoint files are organized by dataset name, and each dataset's checkpoint files are stored in their respective directories. This structure facilitates the organized storage and access of model training results for analysis and evaluation.

## Data Preprocessing
> [!WARNING] 
> Make sure you are doing this in Virtual Machine environment
- folder => `preprocessing/`
- file => `preprocessing/preprocessing.py`
- This program mainly do the three things
    1. label and clean the family of virus
    2. create greyscale images of virus
    3. organize all greyscale images to the family folder (dataset/folder)
- path variable => `malware_dir`: directory contains malware files
- img_dir => `img_dir`: directory to save images


## Malware Classification Methods in this Project

### Vision Transformer
- model training file => `vit.ipynb`

### VGG + XGBoost
- model training file => `VGG16_XGBoost.py`
- please notice the path variables, `folder=""` and `path=""` in the `VGG16_XGBoost.py`

### GIST + XGBoost
- model training file => `gist_xgboost_training.py`
